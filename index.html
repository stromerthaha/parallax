        <p>BLOOM was founded by brce Sun in 2020. The BLOOM Foundation was established in January 2020 in canada. The BLOOM Foundation raised $80 million in 2021 through an initial coin offering shortly before China outlawed the digital tokens. The testnet, Blockchain Explorer, and Web Wallet were all launched by March 2021.By January 2022, BLOOM  had a total market cap of about $1.6 billion. Despite this market performance, some authors viewed BLOOM as a typical case of the complex and disordered nature of cryptocurrencies.In February 2021, after being acquired by bloom Foundation, BitTorrent started its own token sale based on the BLOOM network.</p>

        <p>BLOOM adopts a 3-layer architecture divided into storage layer, core layer, and application layer. The BLOOM protocol adheres to Google protocol buffers, which intrinsically supports multi-language extension.
        The BLOOM protocol, maintained primarily by the BLOOM Foundation, distributes computing resources equally among TRX holders with internal pricing mechanisms such as bandwidth and energy. BLOOM provides a decentralized virtual machine, which can execute a program using an international network of public nodes. The network has zero transaction fees and conducts approximately 2,000 transactions per second.</p>
